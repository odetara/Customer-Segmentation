# Customer-Segmentation

**Introduction:**

In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses seeking a competitive edge. Selore Nigeria, an electronics retail chain, is utilizing unsupervised learning techniques to analyze demographic information and spending habits to identify customer segments, thereby enhancing personalized marketing and strategic optimization.

**Project Problem:**

Despite its position as a leading retailer, Selore Nigeria faces the challenge of tailoring its marketing strategies to the diverse preferences and spending behaviors of its customers. A lack of insights into customer segmentation hinders the company's ability to deliver personalized experiences. This project addresses this problem by employing unsupervised learning to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic characteristics.

**Project Objectives:**

The project aims to use unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers, uncover insights, develop targeted marketing strategies, and optimize pricing and product recommendations for Selore Nigeria, enhancing its customer understanding and business strategies.

**Key Insights:**

The analysis has revealed five distinct customer segments with unique characteristics:

•	**Segment dark green:** Customers in this segment exhibit high spending scores and moderate to high annual incomes. They represent a prime audience for premium products and personalized services.

•	**Segment blue:** This segment consists of customers with moderate spending scores and annual incomes. Targeted marketing campaigns focusing on value and affordability are likely to resonate with this group.

•	**Segment pink:** Customers in this segment display low spending scores and lower annual incomes. Strategies should be devised to encourage increased spending, potentially through budget-friendly offers and incentives.

•	**Segment yellow:** This segment showcases high spending scores but with lower annual incomes. Crafting promotions and offers that align with their preferences while considering financial constraints is key.

•	**Segment light green:** Customers in this segment have moderate spending scores and higher annual incomes. They may respond well to exclusive offers and loyalty programs.
